    <h1>Sophie Lynch's Biography</h1>

    <p>
        I’m an advertising major in the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. I’m interested in <strong>digital branding</strong> and I hope to work in the <strong>fashion, beauty, and wellness industry.</strong> I have a minor in information management and technology, and I am also in the fashion and beauty communications milestone at Syracuse University. I’ve been on the Dean’s List since my first semester of college in 2019 to the present. I have good organizational skills and, being in Gen Z, I am fairly tech savvy with a great handle on social media. I also love exercising and am working towards becoming a personal trainer. I just recently got CPR certified which was the first step in the personal training certification process.

        Throughout my life I have always had an interest in fashion and beauty. When I was younger, I would always play dress-up and I was fascinated by different clothing collections in magazines. My view on this industry has evolved from just focusing on clothing and make-up to understanding it’s impact, both positive and negative, on society. During my senior year of high school, I worked with girls ages 8-10 running a book club where we read Strong is the New Pretty and dove deeper into topics surrounding what it means to be pretty. These girls were at the age where they started becoming more self-aware and conscious of their differences from other girls when it comes to outer appearance. I got to see firsthand how our set beauty standards effect young minds and hearts even before they are exposed to social media.

        In recent years, there has been more momentum in the industry to <strong>change the perception of “beautiful”</strong> to a standard where we celebrate body diversity and promote inner beauty. For me, this is where the “wellness component” comes in to play. To jumpstart my career, I have another Instagram page (besides my personal) that focuses on the importance of self-love in our most vulnerable states amidst the constant influx of “perfection” that we are exposed to. For example, I have recently been posting updates of my skin throughout my Accutane journey, which has always been a soft spot for me. With my Instagram page and soon-to-be personal training certification, I hope to help grow the confidence of my followers.
