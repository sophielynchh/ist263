                    Hi! I am currently a freshman at the S.I Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. I’m an Advertising major, with an emphasis in Digital Advertising, and I’m minoring in Information Management and Technology at the iSchool. I am also a student in the Fashion and Beauty Communications Milestone at Syracuse that is in both Newhouse and VPA. I recently got my CPR certification to begin my 6 month course in becoming a personal trainer.

                    I have always been passionate about fashion, beauty, and wellness. But, my zeal for each of these topics has surfaced throughout my life in different ways. When I was young, I put on make-up carelessly and dressed up for fun. Once I hit my teen years, I used these outlets to “dress up” and “cover up” my insecurities. Now, I am trying my best to teach myself, and others, the importance of inner beauty. Rather than hiding our areas that lack confidence, we need to embrace them.  I recently got my CPR certification to begin my 6 month course in becoming a personal trainer. I hope to help others, like the girl I used to be, become more confident in themselves and their bodies.

                    When I was 16, I experienced some serious health issues. I was not only scared of what this meant for my future but I was extremely embarrassed and my self confidence suffered. To this day, it is still hard for me to grapple with. But, throughout all of this, I have learned that in our times of weakness we find our greatest strengths. Out of inspiration, I have decided to make this website to teach others, as I continue to teach myself, the importance of self love throughout all circumstances. </p>
