            Luxury brand, Gucci, celebrates beauty diversity with it's lipstick advertising campaign.
        </h1>
        <p>
            In 2019, Alessandro Michele launched Gucci’s first ever makeup collection. The campaign aims to break societal expectations of beauty and conveys that true and authentic beauty “lies in imperfection.” Dani Miller, the lead singer of Surfbort, is featured in the advertisements. Interestingly and, supposedly purposefully, Miller’s music focuses on politics, social media, sexuality, and mental health. Politics and social media are two platforms that have the power to mold peoples opinions, morals, and perceptions of what is “right” and “good,” including defining beauty and perfection as two interchangable things.

            The print ads of Gucci’s new lipstick products, shot by Martin Parr, are close-up photos of the models mouths showcasing their unedited teeth. The most controversial photo in the campaign is of Dani Miller’s gaps in between her teeth. From looking at the photos alone, they are shot to provoke. Whether they are inciting feelings by showing crooked teeth or from models sticking their tongues out, they are changing the “perfectly straight teeth with big pouty lips” look that many advertising campaigns for lipstick prescribe to.

            Miller's role in the campaign was crucial to Gucci’s launch of its new beauty line, but more importantly, its success in challenging current ideas of beauty in society. In an interview with Glamour, Miller explained that throughout her life she was bullied for her teeth. With age and growth of confidence, she began to embrace her uniqueness with a desire to show people to “let go of the pressures of traditional beauty and perfection.” Gucci’s campaign was the ideal outlet to do this.

            Although there was an overwhelmingly positive reaction to Gucci’s campaign, there was also a lot of controversy over the advertisements. One criticism, written on Instagram, blatantly shows the problem with society's view of beauty as the writer comments, “Doctors can’t be doctors if they aren’t smart. Models can’t be models if they aren’t pretty. That’s just how jobs work.” In comparison to this campaign as a whole, those that are rated the “most talked about new beauty campaigns” (in Harper's Bazaar) still conform to conventional beauty advertisements. Coincidentally, Burberry’s new beauty campaign, also for lipstick, is listed at #1 with Fran Summers posing with pouty lips, clear skin, and styled with impeccable make-up and shiny hair. Clearly, it will take a lot of work to penetrate and change institutionalized beauty standards.

            With this raw and real campaign, Gucci has made global strides by being a luxury brand that not only accepts but celebrates beauty diversity.

        <h1>Real Beauty: Authentic and Unfiltered</h1>
        <h2>Squish Beauty</h2>
        <h3>"Real skin. Real bodies. No retouching." #LoveYourSquish</h3>

        <p>

            In this day and age, the rise of social media comes with insecurity. Young adults, especially women, compare and criticize themselves and their looks based on flawless images of models. However, these pictures don’t depict real women. These models are edited and photoshopped yet we still get sucked into wanting to look just like them.

            Fortunately brands like Squish Beauty are beginning to take a stance on this issue. Squish Beauty is a vegan skincare line that was created by Charli Howard who began modeling at the age of 21 for a London-based agency. In 2015, Howard was fired for being “too big” to be a model. Howard is a size US 6-8 yet she is considered to be a plus-size model. Since being dropped from the agency, Howard became an activist for body diversity in the fashion industry. These experiences and beliefs launched this new line, considered by Elle Magazine as the “most exciting beauty brand of 2019.”

            Squish Beauty is not only an advocate against body shaming but also provides a positive environment and view on models who struggle with acne and acne scarring. Most consumers buying beauty products are insecure about their skin, especially when seeing models with airbrushed, flawless skin promoting the products. Squish Beauty is a powerful force in young adults' lives as it helps customers have confidence in their own real skin and  it challenges the status quo that says all models should have “perfect” skinny bodies and glowing skin. This “perfection” isn’t real life, it isn’t authentic, and in fact it’s boring... and Squish understands that.

            Charli Howard explained in Vogue that she, “...wanted young girls to see themselves in a skincare product.” She went on to say, “It’s cool, it’s fresh and it’s something I’m really proud of.” Howard has taken one of the first steps in improving the beauty industry by promoting authentic women and their beauty in having cellulite, stretch marks, and acne.

            As a 19 year old girl, I understand the struggle of constantly scrolling through endless pictures of other women being their “best” selves--skinny, perfect hair, perfect skin, etc. It’s important to me and to other girls to know that real women, and their imperfections, can be models and more importantly, flawless too.
