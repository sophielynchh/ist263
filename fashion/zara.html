                    Behind every unique piece of fashion is a story. The flapper dress was created following the “flapper” woman. In the 1920s, women who embraced their independence by living an exciting and outrageous lifestyle were coined “Flappers.” The rise of the flappers began during World War 1 when women first entered the workforce in large numbers. Additionally, women were given the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment in August of 1920. Flapper dresses, with their revealing fit, encompassed the dashing and daring woman of the 20s.

                    The Crocheted Dress is inspired by the flapper dress of the 1920s. By pairing the feathered, fringed, and low-dropping waist of the flapper with the new crochet trend in 2021, Zara has transformed the traditional flapper to a chic piece that fits in with the current trends.
