                    Behind every unique piece of fashion is a story. The flapper dress was created following the “flapper” woman. In the 1920s, women who embraced their independence by living an exciting and outrageous lifestyle were coined “Flappers.” The rise of the flappers began during World War 1 when women first entered the workforce in large numbers. Additionally, women were given the right to vote with the passage of the 19th Amendment in August of 1920. Flapper dresses, with their revealing fit, encompassed the dashing and daring woman of the 20s.

                    The Crocheted Dress is inspired by the flapper dress of the 1920s. By pairing the feathered, fringed, and low-dropping waist of the flapper with the new crochet trend in 2021, Zara has transformed the traditional flapper to a chic piece that fits in with the current trends.

                <p>
                    Christian Dior shocked society with his debut of “The New Look”. With its tight waist, voluminous skirt, and structured bust, it makes for a classic and elegant look that first celebrated femininity. Post-wartime fashion, The New Look changed women’s clothing from harsh and masculine to soft and flowy. It gave rise to radical change in the fashion industry. The New Look was made to celebrate the female body and all its beauty.

                    This look has transformed into the currently popular “midi” dress. Midi dresses are the perfect length—they come just below the knee which makes the body look elongated and slimmer. Midi dresses are less poufy than “The New Look” which is the modern twist. They accentuate the body’s curves but falling and draping along the waist effortlessly.

            <p>
                Victorian Frills were outrageous and glamourous. The Woman Behind the Frills was prim and proper yet extravagant and exciting. She was a beautiful ideal of femininity, but she had strength and gusto which was portrayed through her wardrobe. The frills were embellishments to both the piece of clothing and the wearer herself; they were a way to show prestige, beauty, and confidence.
