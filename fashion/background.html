                Zara is currently my favorite clothing store. it’s popular, especially amongst Gen Z, and hyped up on every social media platform. The one problem that customers have with Zara is its confusing website. The photographs of the clothes aren’t displayed with their description and they repeat awkwardly throughout the website. In my personal opinion, whenever I try to shop online at Zara, I end up leaving the site because of how frustrated it makes me. Maybe I’m just inpatient and quick to anger when I want to pull the trigger on a shopping cart…but as far as I can see, I’m not the only one bothered by the website set-up.

                I originally went into this project wanting to take my favorite clothing site and revamp it so it’s easier on the customers eyes and more user-friendly. In order to incorporate my major, Advertising, and my minor, Information Management and Technology, I thought it would be cool to redesign the website with my coding skills and make it simpler. Additionally, I wanted to “rebrand” Zara and find pieces that are inspired by prominent fashion trends throughout history. Hence, how I got the name “Back to the Future” for the newest collection: in appreciation of historical trends promoted on Zara’s website, we’re traveling into the past…but the new website is the future of Zara.
