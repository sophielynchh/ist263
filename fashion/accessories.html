                        <p>
                            The cloche hat, invented in 1908 by Caroline Reboux, was one accessory that every woman had in her closet especially in the 1920s. The hat was fitted and bell-shaped. Its most distinguishing feature was its low brim. The cloche hats were adorned with feathers, rhinestones, and ribbons. Cloche hats added confidence and independence to the wearer’s outfits.

                            The more casual cloche hat of 2021 is the bucket hat. Bucket hats have risen to popularity because they are practical in sunny weather and they are also cute and fashionable. They add an extra element of spunk to every outfit.

                    <p>
                        Post-WWII during the baby boom generation, women were expected to stay home, take care of the kids, and clean all while looking perfect for their husbands. Pearl jewelry was viewed as classy and beautiful— a vision of domestic refinement.

                        Today, pearls are incorporated through jewelry but also by being sewn into clothes. Pearls have been placed on the neckline and also along the front of cardigans in the place of buttons. The Vivienne Westwood Mini Bas Relief Pearl Choker necklace has become trendy for Millennials and Gen Z. Inspired by the pearl trend throughout history, the Pack of Natural Pearl Necklaces combines the popular gold layered necklace with addition of the classy pearl.
